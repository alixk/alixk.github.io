I am an academic librarian focusing on supporting researchers in the digital humanities and social sciences. I consult, teach, and collaborate on projects related to text and data mining, digital history, diversity and representation in digital scholarship, community engagement, and critical digital studies. Most recently I was the Digital Scholarship Librarian at the University of Michigan Library, where I earned my MSI in 2014.
