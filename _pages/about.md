I am a program manager, academic technologist, and librarian focusing on supporting researchers in the digital humanities and social sciences. I consult, teach, and collaborate on projects related to text and data mining, digital history, diversity and representation in digital scholarship, community engagement, and critical digital studies. Currently, I am a Program Manager at the UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley campus. Before that, I was the Digital Scholarship Librarian at the University of Michigan Library, where I earned my MSI in 2014.
